Priority Inversion: Explains the fundamental problem of priority inversion (a low-priority task holding a needed resource blocks a high-priority task)

Priority Inheritance: Overview focusing on Linux/RTOS context: how a real-time kernel handles priority inversion via priority inheritance.

Priority Protection: Explains how “priority ceiling” resources are statically assigned a ceiling priority, and a task locking the resource immediately inherits that ceiling (“protection”) 
even before a blocking event.

Q1:
- Time t = 0
T2 (low-priority) starts running and locks the shared resource. It begins doing work while holding the lock.
  
- Time t = 2
T1 (high-priority) arrives and tries to use the shared resource. But the lock is held by T2. T1 must block and wait.
Under normal priority rules, since T1 is highest priority, the CPU should ideally switch to T1 immediately. But it cannot because T2 has the lock.

- Time t = 3
T3 (medium-priority) arrives. T1 is waiting. T2 should continue running to finish and release the lock for T1. However, since T3 has higher priority than T2, the scheduler picks T3.

Result:
T3 runs, while:

T1 (highest priority) is forced to wait

T2 (lowest priority), which holds the lock, cannot run

The low-priority task (T2) ends up blocking the high-priority task (T1), because the medium-priority task (T3) interrupts it before it can release the lock.
“Inversion” = the high-priority task ends up lower than everyone else.


Q2:

Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP)

Timeline:
t=0→1: T2 runs (prio 3, but no competition yet).
t=1: T1 arrives, blocks on T2’s lock. T2 inherits T1’s priority → T2 now runs at priority 1.
t=1→5: Boosted T2 continues and finishes its CS at t=5.
t=5→9: T1 acquires the lock and runs its CS, finishes at t=9.
t=9→12: T3 runs (no lock), finishes at t=12.


Priority Protection Protocol (PPP)

Timeline:
t=0→5: T2 runs at ceiling priority and finishes its CS at t=5.
t=5→9: T1 runs its CS, finishes at t=9.
t=9→12: T3 runs, finishes at t=12.

1. T2 executes 5 time units.
2. T2 finishes CS at t=5 (PPP & PIP)
3. Total Execution Time = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12 (PPP & PIP)
4. Neither protocol causes priority inversion delay for T1 here. Under PIP, T1 is blocked only by T2’s remaining CS (4 units after t=1), not by T3. PPP prevents any inversion proactively.
5. PIP: T3 arrives at t=2 but cannot preemptly boost T2 (now priority 1) and later cannot preempt T1, so T3 runs after T1, from t=9→12.
  PPP: T3 is kept out while T2 holds the ceiling and later while T1 runs; it executes last (t=9→12). Under PPP this is guaranteed from the moment T2 locks, even if T1 hadn’t arrived yet.
